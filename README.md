 **MangosFour - The Mists of Pandaria WoW Database**
===

This is the database to support the MangosFour server.

It aims to be 100% compatible with the final version of MOP [World of Warcraft][2],
namely [patch 5.4.8][4].


Dependencies
------------
The server stands on the shoulders of several well-known Open Source libraries plus
a few awesome, but less known libraries to prevent us from inventing the wheel again.

**Please note that Linux and Mac OS X users should install packages using
their systems package management instead of source packages.**

* **[MySQL][40]** / **[MariaDB][41]**: These databases are used to store content and user data.

<br>We have a small, but extremely friendly and helpful community managed by MadMax and Antz.


Our discord/forum motto is: 
```js
'Be nice or Be somewhere else'
```
Any trolling or unpleasantness is swiftly dealt with !!
